## Hello World

Go ships with its own template engine, split into two packages,
`text/template` and `html/template`.
These packages are similar in functionality,
with the difference that `html/template` allows a user to generate HTML code that is safe against code injection,
making it suitable for use on web pages and emails.


To use code assistance in Go templates,
ensure that your project folder is under GOPATH (for example, go/src/myProject).
To check your GOPATH, open settings âŒ˜, and navigate to Go | GOPATH.
