## Goroutines

> A **goroutine** is a lightweight thread of execution.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=goroutines.go) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from goroutines.go -->
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func f(from string) {
	for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
		fmt.Println(from, ":", i)
	}
}

func main() {

	// Run "synchronously"
	f("Direct")

	// Use "go f(string)" to invoke this function in a "goroutine"
	// This new "goroutine" will execute concurrently with the calling one
	go f("Goroutine")

	// Start a "goroutine" for an "anonymous function" call
	go func(message string) {
		fmt.Println(message)
	}("Going")

	// Two function calls above are running "asynchronously" in separate "goroutines" now

	// Pause for at least the "duration"
	duration := time.Second
	fmt.Println("Sleep with Duration :", duration)
	time.Sleep(duration)
	fmt.Println("Done")
}
```
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```bash
$ go run goroutines.go

# Direct : 0
# Direct : 1
# Direct : 2
# Direct : 3

# Goroutine : 0
# Sleep with Duration : 1s
# Goroutine : 1
# Goroutine : 2
# Goroutine : 3
# Going

# Done
```


## Channels

> **Channels** are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines.
> You can send values into **channels** from one goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=channels.go) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from channels.go -->
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
)

func main() {

	// Create a new channel with "make(chan value-type)"
	// Channels are typed by the values they convey
	messages := make(chan string)
	fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(messages))

	// "channel <-": send a value into a channel
	go func() { messages <- "ping" }()

	// "<-channel": receive a value from the channel
	msg := <-messages
	fmt.Println(msg)
}
```
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```bash
$ go run channels.go

# chan string
# ping
```


## Channel Buffering

- By default, **channels** are **unbuffered**, meaning that they will only accept sends (`chan <-`) if there is a corresponding receive (`<-chan`) ready to receive the sent value.
- **Buffered channels** accept a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver for those values.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=channel-buffering.go) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from channel-buffering.go -->
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
)

func main() {

	// Here we make a channel of strings buffering up to "2" values
	messages := make(chan string, 2)
	fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(messages))

	// Because this channel is buffered,
	// we can send these values into the channel without a corresponding concurrent receive
	messages <- "buffered"
	messages <- "channel"

	// Later we can receive these "2" values as usual
	fmt.Println(<-messages)
	fmt.Println(<-messages)
}
```
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```bash
$ go run channel-buffering.go

# chan string

# buffered
# channel
```


## Channel Synchronization

> We can use **channels** to synchronize execution across **goroutines**.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=channel-synchronization.go) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from channel-synchronization.go -->
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// This is the function we will run in a goroutine
// The "done" channel will be used to notify another goroutine
func worker(done chan bool) {
	fmt.Print("Working... ")
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Done")

	// Send a value to notify that we are done
	done <- true
}

func main() {

	// Start a "worker" goroutine
	done := make(chan bool, 1)
	go worker(done)

	// Block until we receive a notification from the "worker" on the channel
	<-done
}
```
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```bash
$ go run channel-synchronization.go

# Working... Done
```

- If you removed the `<-done` line from this program, the program would exit before the worker even started.


## Channel Directions

> When using **channels** as function parameters, you can specify if a **channel** is meant to only send or receive values.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=channel-directions.go) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from channel-directions.go -->
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// "pings chan<- string": a channel for sending values,
// would be a compile-time error to try to receive on this channel
func ping(pings chan<- string, msg string) {
	pings <- msg
}

// "pings <-chan string": a channel for receives
// "pongs chan<- string": a channel for sends
func pong(pings <-chan string, pongs chan<- string) {
	msg := <-pings
	pongs <- msg
}

func main() {
	pings := make(chan string, 1)
	pongs := make(chan string, 1)

	ping(pings, "passed message")
	pong(pings, pongs)
	fmt.Println(<-pongs)
}
```
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```bash
$ go run channel-directions.go

# passed message
```


## Select

> Go's `select` lets you wait on multiple channel operations. Combining goroutines and channels with select is a powerful feature of Go.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=select.go) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from select.go -->
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {

	// For our example we'll select across two channels
	c1 := make(chan string)
	c2 := make(chan string)

	// Each channel will receive a value after some amount of time,
	// to simulate e.g. blocking RPC operations executing in concurrent goroutines
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		c1 <- "one"
	}()
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		c2 <- "two"
	}()

	// We'll use select to await both of these values simultaneously,
	// printing each one as it arrives
	for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
		select {
		case msg1 := <-c1:
			fmt.Println("received", msg1)
		case msg2 := <-c2:
			fmt.Println("received", msg2)
		}
	}
}
```
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

- We receive the values "one" and then "two" as expected.

```bash
$ go run select.go

# received one
# received two

# real 0m2.245s
```

- Note that the total execution time is only ~2 seconds since both the 1 and 2 second Sleeps execute concurrently.


## Timeouts

> Timeouts are important for programs that connect to external resources or that otherwise need to bound execution time. Implementing timeouts in Go is easy and elegant thanks to channels and select.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=timeouts.go) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from timeouts.go -->
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {

	// For our example, suppose we're executing an external call that returns its result on a channel c1 after 2s
	// Note that the channel is buffered, so the send in the goroutine is nonblocking
	// This is a common pattern to prevent goroutine leaks in case the channel is never read
	c1 := make(chan string, 1)
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		c1 <- "result 1"
	}()

	// Here's the select implementing a timeout.
	// res := <-c1 awaits the result and <-Time.After awaits a value to be sent after the timeout of 1s
	// Since select proceeds with the first receive that's ready,
	// we'll take the timeout case if the operation takes more than the allowed 1s
	select {
	case res := <-c1:
		fmt.Println(res)
	case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("timeout 1")
	}

	// If we allow a longer timeout of 3s, then the receive from c2 will succeed and we'll print the result.
	c2 := make(chan string, 1)
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		c2 <- "result 2"
	}()
	select {
	case res := <-c2:
		fmt.Println(res)
	case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("timeout 2")
	}
}
```
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

- Running this program shows the first operation timing out and the second succeeding.

```bash
$ go run timeouts.go

# timeout 1
# result 2
```


## Non-Blocking Channel Operations

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=non-blocking-channel-operations.go) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from non-blocking-channel-operations.go -->
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	messages := make(chan string)
	signals := make(chan bool)

	select {
	case msg := <-messages:
		fmt.Println("received message", msg)
	default:
		fmt.Println("no message received")
	}

	msg := "hi"
	select {
	case messages <- msg:
		fmt.Println("sent message", msg)
	default:
		fmt.Println("no message sent")
	}

	select {
	case msg := <-messages:
		fmt.Println("received message", msg)
	case sig := <-signals:
		fmt.Println("received signal", sig)
	default:
		fmt.Println("no activity")
	}
}
```
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```bash
$ go run non-blocking-channel-operations.go

# no message received
# no message sent
# no activity
```


## Closing Channels

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=closing-channels.go) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from closing-channels.go -->
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	jobs := make(chan int, 5)
	done := make(chan bool)

	go func() {
		for {
			j, more := <-jobs
			if more {
				fmt.Println("received job", j)
			} else {
				fmt.Println("received all jobs")
				done <- true
				return
			}
		}
	}()

	for j := 1; j <= 3; j++ {
		jobs <- j
		fmt.Println("sent job", j)
	}
	close(jobs)
	fmt.Println("sent all jobs")

	<-done
}
```
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```bash
$ go run closing-channels.go

# sent job 1
# sent job 2
# sent job 3
# sent all jobs
# received job 1
# received job 2
# received job 3
# received all jobs
```


## Range over Channels

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=range-over-channels.go) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from range-over-channels.go -->
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	queue := make(chan string, 2)
	queue <- "one"
	queue <- "two"
	close(queue)

	for elem := range queue {
		fmt.Println(elem)
	}
}
```
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```bash
$ go run range-over-channels.go

# one
# two
```
